# Forest-Animal-Counter-using-Machine-Learning
IOT Project

In our animal detection project, we aim to address the challenges faced by huntsmen in managing and conserving wildlife populations, particularly in forests near expanding cities. Deforestation, habitat fragmentation, and degradation have resulted in the loss of habitat for forest wildlife, leading to population declines and even extinction in some cases.

One specific issue we're tackling is the supplementary feeding of animals when they have difficulty accessing food. Currently, grain or seed feeders are set to distribute food every day at a certain amount, along with the amount of hay present in hay racks. However, huntsmen have no way of knowing whether a herd of large deer or elks will consume it or just a single roe deer. This lack of information often results in either insufficient or excessive amounts of food being provided, which can impact wildlife health and habitat sustainability.
